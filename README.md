# Kaggle-Home-Credit-Default-Risk

To perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the `application_train.csv` file for building a credit risk model, we will proceed with the following steps:

1. **Load the Data**: Read the `application_train.csv` file into dataframe to explore it's contents.

2. **Understand the Metadata**: Use `HomeCredit_columns_description.csv` to understand what each column in `application_train.csv` represents.

3. **Preliminary Data Inspection**: 
    - Check the shape of the dataset.
    - View the first few rows to understand the structure and contents.
    - Check for duplicate entries.

4. **Feature Engineering**: 
    - Create new features if applicable.

5. **Data Cleaning/ Missing Values Analysis**: 
    - Handle missing values.
    - Identify the columns with missing values.
    - Determine the best strategy for handling missing data.
    - Correct data types if necessary.

6. **Target Variable Analysis**: 
    - Analyze the distribution of the `TARGET` variable.

7. **Feature Analysis**: 
    - Analyze the distributions and relationships of the features with the target.
    - Perform univariate analysis.
    - Perform bivariate analysis.

8. **Correlation Analysis**: 
    - Check the correlation of features with the target and among themselves.

9. **Outlier Detection**: 
    - Detect and handle outliers in the dataset.

10. **Feature Elimination**: 
    - Eliminate features using different techniques

**Data Visualization**: 
- Use visualizations to understand the data better.
